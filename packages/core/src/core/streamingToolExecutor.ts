 *
 * It is intentionally execution-free — calling `CoreToolScheduler.schedule()`,
 * sibling-suppression for `structured_output`, and history submission of
 * `functionResponse` parts all stay with the caller.
 *
 * Lifecycle states (mutually exclusive):
 *   - Open: accepting requests and recording results.
 *   - Closed: producing stream ended; no more accepts; existing buffer
 *     remains drainable via `getCompletedResults()` / `getRemainingResults()`.
 *   - Discarded: terminal error path; buffer wiped, pending consumers
 *     rejected, all further accepts / records are no-ops. Supersedes Closed
 *     (`discard()` after `close()` clears the closed flag).
 *
 * Transition picker — when the producing side signals an event, the caller
 * picks one of three methods:
 *
 * | Trigger                              | Method      | Buffer | Pending consumers | Final state |
 * |--------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
 * | normal stream end / consumer break   | `close()`   | kept   | kept pending      | Closed      |
 * | mid-stream retry                     | `reset(r)`  | wiped  | rejected (reason) | Open        |
 * | abort / unauthorized / stream-error  | `discard(r)`| wiped  | rejected (reason) | Discarded   |
 *
 * Pending `getRemainingResults()` consumers stay pending across `close()`
 * when the buffer isn't complete — the caller must deposit the missing
 * results (success path) or call `discard()` / `reset()` to release them.
 *
 * Single-Turn ownership is assumed — sharing an executor across concurrent
 * Turns would let `reset()` from one Turn surprise the other.
